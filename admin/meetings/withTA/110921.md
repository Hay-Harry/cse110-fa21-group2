2.  Get todos for next week

Discussion:

- Todos for next week:
Documentation - Internal Documentation : ADR - due tomorrow
CI/CD Pipeline - Phase 1 - Checkpoint 1 due 11/15
Finish design for saved recipe page, recipe page
Finish skeleton for saved recipe page, recipe page. Similar to what Faris have done last week. 
Write javascript code for our htmls. (Example. Clicking a recipe should redirect to a recipe page with all info populated)
We can keep pages in separate htmls for now, don’t need to worry about SPA this week. For example, clicking a recipe redirect to a new Hyperlink for recipe page. JS on the backend will populate the info to the recipe page.

- New data storage procedure:
If local storage is empty, fetch __ number of recipe and save to local storage.
If local storage is not empty, fetch recipe directly from local storage.
If local storage is not enough, can also consider indexDB.

- API:
Spoontacular has educational permission with 5000 recipe/day, request educational ASAP

- Checkpoints:
We have to demo functional pages next Monday during discussion.
MVP should be done completely by the end of week8.

- Waiting for TA’s response:
TA will get back to us about reusing code in lab6.
