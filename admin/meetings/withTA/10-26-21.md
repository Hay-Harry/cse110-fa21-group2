**About Data Store and Log-in:**

- Don’t need a log-in

- Data store: no log-in no database

- how to update the recipe: use local storage

- Multiple user concurrently use the app - need log-in

- If just local to the phone, no need to login - user’s browser locally

- **Prob**: Local storage can not store all of the recipes - capped

- API for database: **indexedDB**

  - Most user friendly one

  

**Prob with UI’s:Web app**

- open on the desktopUi also for the desktop - separate Ui?
- Need to open it on the desktop - scale
- Smart approach to focus UI primarily on mobile
- Make sure it looks okay on desktop
- Try to toggle between diff devices while debugging

**Missing Elements:**

- **User story** - focus on **features** that the user want in the app
  - Acceptance criteriaNeed to be added!!!
- **User persona** - bio/ general info about the people themselves
  - Which we already have
  - Example in the slides **“Brainstorming**” shared on slack

**Other things:**

- Timeline for the project
- Start with **Pitch** assignment
  - *Shape Up*
    - Go over the chapter about how to write pitch document
- Must finish Pitch and show that to TA and then start coding!
- Can start style coding based on the UI drawn using HTML
- Assign the rolesInternal roles:
  - Front-end
    - UI
    - Javascript according to UI…
  - Back-end：no database, no backend lol…
- Subteams
  - I.e.: 2 front-end work on one UI…
- Can start now!
