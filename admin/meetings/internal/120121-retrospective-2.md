# Agenda
1. Getting team members to write down what should've been done during the sprint, what should stop, and what should continue. 

# Top Results on Retrium 
1. Tasks Planning Procedure. Splitting tasks according to story points so that it's fair and would not put too much burden on certain people. Planned tasks out a lot better than previous sprint(s). Good procedure for creating issues, pull requests, and maintaining a fluid workflow. Splitting tasks into smaller chunks that make sense. 
2. More documentation during development. Add in comments for what's there and to explain what certain functions do and what certain parts of the code exactly mean. 
3. Check in on Process. More personal check-ins for progress. See what exactly is holding back each team member and see what would be done to help them. Smaller meetings to clarify and assign tasks.

# All Results on Retrium
1. Each weekly meeting/ sprint retro/ review/ mob session should try to go through core files to clean and prune it so it looks neater and only necessary code is present. 
2. Pipeline. Linting. Making Faris the pipeline.
3. Be clear about the remaining tasks that we need to finish and also the deadlines. 
4. Team dynamic. Helping other teammates along with having pretty good teamwork and synergy. 

# Retro worth our time?
3.6/5.

# Comments/ Suggestions
1. Have tasks assign and have team leads reach out later to see their gameplan on proceeding with tasks.
2. Have more clear deadlines on tasks in the future.
