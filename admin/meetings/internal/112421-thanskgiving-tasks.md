# Context
We need to do some extra work over Thanksgiving Break in order to have a working MVP so that weeks 10 and 11 are less stressful. If we get this done, by then we will only have to worry about testing, UI changes, and pushing small bug fixes or miniscule features.

# Meeting result
Everyone should continue working on their current/new tasks to complete MVP soon. 


# Agenda

1. Role call for everyone's current and completed tasks, as some tasks that were issued were done so verbally and not over GitHub Issues.
2. Assign new tasks to Jon and Antonia
3. Review index.html for relevant parties
3.1 Decide on how Expanded Recipe Page will work (component or nested in index.html?)

# Meeting Minutes

## General notes
- Get working MVP by Week 10
- Need to populate saved recipe page
- Ideally have MVP done before sunday retrospective
- We already have html set up for expanded recipe page
    - Expanded recipe page goes in recipe-info hidden in index.html
- 2 extra features
    - Ingredient scaling
    - Timer or multiple lists; Timer might be easier
        - Need to decide where to put Timer
- Expanded recipe page, 2 options
    - Copy paste html, put into section in index.html
    - Web component
- Search results page
    - Still need to make call to api from search bar and populate search results page


## Status/Tasks of each member/subteam

## Observations by team
1. Need to fix "require" line in apiHelpers.js as it does not work in browser

# Conclusions
1. Expanded Recipe Page will be nested in index.html instead of being a web component
2. Finish MVP ASAP
