2. Retrospective.

# Meeting Minutes

## Status of each member/subteam sprint review

1. Alex- Get code into populating recipe pages and getting recipes from local storage. Getting recipes from API to correctly populate recipe page.
2. Laurence- Get expanded recipe page working with dummy data. Working on clearing sort/filter button. 
3. Misha- Getting router to work. Collaborating with other teammates and assisting them with their own tasks. Busy with heavy workload. 
4. Harry- Sort and filtering event handlers for search. Did work on explore page. 
5. Robert- Redid some of the fetch API functions/ helper functions and getting his code to work with Harry's event handlers. Working on how to hide API key. Reformatted code to be cleaner. 
6. Jon- Worked on back-end for timer and its functionality and the sort and filtering interface along with event handlers for it. 
7. Antonia- Worked on recipe page CSS and timer. Timer UI is finished and is now draggable. Working with the task management team and waiting for tasks. 
8. Britney- Worked on planning poker and on getting JSDocs done. Getting files into workflow and handling conflicts. Handling task and general management.
9. Faris- Working on the router and getting the site to become a SPA. Working on UI and a lot of other things skipped over :).
10. Fred- Implemented create recipe functionality along with delete recipe. Getting prior functions to work with local storage and front end. Implemented saved recipes page and getting the lists to work correctly. Getting create recipe page to be more responsive and correctly redirect. 
11. Kaiwen- Status video editing. Getting tasks distributed with Britney and had individual meetings with the majority of the team to see what needs to get done. 

## Observations by team

1. The workload would have been fair if this was the only class taken. However, with the workload of other classes taken into account, managing tasks for this class was a lot harder to manage. 

# Conclusions

1. We will need to have a clearer overarching plan if we all want to contribute fairly to the project, rather than a single person at the last second spaghetti-coding to a MVP. 
2. Tasks (via GitHub Issues) will have to be decomposed better and be more clear.
3. We will hold an emergency Mob Programming Session ASAP to refactor.
