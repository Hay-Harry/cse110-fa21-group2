# Context
We need to do some extra work over Thanksgiving Break in order to have a working MVP so that weeks 10 and 11 are less stressful. If we get this done, by then we will only have to worry about testing, UI changes, and pushing small bug fixes or miniscule features.

# Agenda

1. Role call for everyone's current and completed tasks, as some tasks that were issued were done so verbally and not over GitHub Issues.
2. Assign new tasks to Jon and Antonia
3. Review index.html for relevant parties
3.1 Decide on how Expanded Recipe Page will work (component or nested in index.html?)
