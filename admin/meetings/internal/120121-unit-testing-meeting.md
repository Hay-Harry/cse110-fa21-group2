# Context

We finished out sprint review and retrospective. We are now moving onto our gameplan for unit testing. 

# Meeting result
Adjourn the meeting and have everybody get started on writing their unit test cases.

# Agenda

1. Go over everybody's tasks regarding to unit testing

# Meeting Minutes

## Plan for unit testing

1. Everybody who wrote helper functions (ie Harry, Fred, Robert, etc) will one unit test for each of their functions.
2. Have two people assigned to them to write more unit tests for them.
3. Write unit tests that pass and fail as they should (ie invalid input).

# Conclusions

1. Have a document to coordinate unit testing that should say who should work with who and with which functions specifically.
2. Have everybody have a specific number of tests so that the workload is balanced.
