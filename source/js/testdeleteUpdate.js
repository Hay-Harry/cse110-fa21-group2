          "Chianti, Trebbiano, and Verdicchio are my top picks for Italian. Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Felsina Berardenga Chianti Classico ( Half-bottle) with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.",

          "Riesling, Sparkling Wine, and Zinfandel are great choices for Southern. In general, there are a few rules that will help you pair wine with southern food. Food-friendly riesling or sparkling white wine will work with many fried foods, while zinfandel is great with barbecued fare. The Selbach Oster Zeltinger Himmelreich Riesling Kabinett Halbtrocken with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 21 dollars per bottle.",

      instructions:
        "Prepare a cookie sheet by greasing with non-stick cooking spray. Preheat oven to 350. Cream butter and sugar together in your mixer, scraping the sides of your bowl. Add your egg and mix well. Mix in baking powder, baking soda, Kool-Aid and cornstarch. Once its well mixed (the Kool-Aid will be mixed once it turns your dough pink), add a drop of pink food coloring, if more color is desired. Next, start adding your flour a half cup at a time until its all added.Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and roll in the powder sugar, giving them a light coating. Place 2 apart on a room-temp baking sheet (let your sheet cool in between batches if you are reusing the same one).Bake in the oven 9-10 minutes, they wont brown too much, so watch them closely. Over-baking will make them hard and crunchy!I hope you enjoy these! I will be baking another batch soon, we have a neighborhood barbecue coming up and I know these will be perfect!Want more Whistle and Ivy? Subscribe here!

          "Cream Sherry, Bordeaux, and Champagne are great choices for Crepes. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.",

      instructions:
        "<p>Combine flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, cinnamon. Stir in milk and egg until just combined. Fold in apple. Pour oil into skillet so that it is approximately 1 1/2 deep. Heat oil on high. Oil is ready when a little dough thrown in floats to top. Carefully add dough to oil in heaping teaspoons. Cook until brown, about 2 minutes, then flip. Cook another 1-2 minutes, until both sides are browned. Transfer briefly to paper towels to absorb excess oil, then transfer to cooling rack. Make glaze by stirring milk and powdered sugar together in a small bowl. Drizzle over apple fritters. Wait approximately 3 minutes for glaze to harden, then flip fritters and drizzle glaze over the other side. Best served warm.</p>",

Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.",
