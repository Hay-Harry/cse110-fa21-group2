## Context and Problem Statement

We want to record design decision for login or local in this project.
Should we use login to save different user profile on cloud or only one locally

## Considered Options

*login with user database
*Local Storage


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Local Storage", because

* For the scope of our project, local storage is enough
* We do not have enough time and skill to implement a user database and cloud server.
* Our users only use our website on their devices, no need to have a login.
