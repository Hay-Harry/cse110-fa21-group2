## Context and Problem Statement

We want to record design decision for this project.
Which design should we use ?

## Considered Options
(Both designs on Miro: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lpl-XMA=/)
* 1. Original design with blue background
* 2. New design Faris implemented


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: design 2, because

* The new minimalized design is a lot cleaner than the old one.
* Since we already have a lot of the skeleton code for the new design, switching to the new design won't hurt our progress.
