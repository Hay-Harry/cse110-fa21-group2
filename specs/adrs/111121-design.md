## Context and Problem Statement

We have created two UI designed and need to decide which to use as the basis for our app, which will be implemented by the design team. 

## Considered Options
(Both designs on Miro: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lpl-XMA=/)
* 1. Original design with blue background
* 2. New design Faris implemented


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: design 2, because

* The new minimalized design is a lot cleaner than the old one.
* Since we already have a lot of the skeleton code for the new design, switching to the new design won't hurt our progress.
