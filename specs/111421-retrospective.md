# Agenda
1. write down ideas that would have a positive impact on the team, things that we should stop, and good things that worked well. 
2. 2.Group similar note. 
3. vote 
1. review the top 5 notes as a group.

# Top Result on Retrium 
1. Defining tasks ahead of time and putting them in the backlog to make sure that everyone will have something to work on once they finish a task.
2. assign some individual tasks instead of having us work on the same thing with a partner
3. perhaps have more sub-meetings between teams that need it (so as to organize related aspects)
4. github issues made it very clear what tasks needed to be done and by who
5. A clear documented version of the workflow (a step by step on who to tag as reviewers, who takes over the code, and who is supposed to merge the pull reqs)

# All Result on Retrium
1. More up to date documentation
2. Have a collective page where each subteam updates the progress regularly.
3. A clear documented version of the workflow (a step by step on who to tag as reviewers, who takes over the code, and who is supposed to merge the pull reqs)
4. uniform clarifications before moving forward (for instance, underlying data format, etc.; we're working on this though)
5. Consistent Meeting Minutes style
6. Just having more frequent discussion between teams that are working on the code so we are not doing things in different ways
7. More specific and fast moving meeting agendas (i.e. point by point, not just general topics)
8. calendar of all deadlines (perhaps a week before they are due)
9. maybe some separate slack channels for each team or topic so the general chat does blow up with random stuff
10. More research on tools so we can create better plan
11. More transparency and announcements to keep everyone in the loop
12. more communication between smaller teams
13. Once someone does have too many work to do, he or she could send a message to the slack/team lead to volunteer to help other teams.
14. reply in thread for slack if the answer is directed towards a certain message
15. Defining tasks ahead of time and putting them in the backlog to make sure that everyone will have something to work on once they finish a task.
16. perhaps have more sub-meetings between teams that need it (so as to organize related aspects)
17. assign some individual tasks instead of having us work on the same thing with a partner
18. Meeting notes for each meeting!
19. splitting up people to write html code is creating some inconsistencies for each page template. maybe we should have our actual SPA index.html first with all work there and make sure all new code is aligned with the same structure?
20. communication between teams during meetings
21. github issues made it very clear what tasks needed to be done and by who
22. daily standups are a really cool way to remind us to work on the project a little each day
23. Having well defined tasks for the teams to keep things modular
24. standups are nice
25. Weekly meeting
26. emphasis on pipeline and repo organization
27. Continue doing standups in order to get an idea of what everyone is working on/ finding out when someone doesn't have a task
28. I like the daily standup since it keeps reminding me what I should do for the day and it will be easier for everyone to stay in tune.
29. github issues are great
